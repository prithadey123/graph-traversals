This project implements **Graph Traversal Algorithms** in C using an **Adjacency List representation**.

The program demonstrates:

- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Undirected Graph construction
- Use of arrays and linked lists

 Concept Overview

 Graph (Data Structure)

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of:

- Vertices (Nodes)
- Edges (Connections)

Graphs are widely used in:
- Networking
- Pathfinding algorithms
- Social networks
- AI and search problems


- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Implemented using **recursion**.
- Uses a `visited[]` array to avoid revisiting nodes.
